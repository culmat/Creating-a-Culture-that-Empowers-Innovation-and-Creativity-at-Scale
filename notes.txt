All Job Titles are wrong, but some are useful. -> Im from IT

  Insurance is in fact IT with an insurance twist.

Internal vs External Innovation

Failure

==> So how do we do that?

Creativity is the foundational mental capacity to generate novel ideas, connections, or perspectives. It's about thinking differently, seeing patterns others miss, or imagining possibilities that don't yet exist. Creativity is cognitive and abstract—it happens in your mind when you make unexpected associations or challenge conventional thinking. For example, wondering "what if we could carry a thousand songs in our pocket?" is creative thinking.

Ideation is the systematic process of generating, developing, and communicating ideas. It's creativity in action—the deliberate practice of producing and refining concepts. Ideation typically involves techniques like brainstorming, mind mapping, or design thinking workshops. It takes raw creative impulses and shapes them into more concrete concepts that can be evaluated and refined. Using the earlier example, ideation would involve sketching out different ways a portable music device might work, considering user needs, and exploring various technical approaches.

Innovation is the successful implementation of creative ideas that create value. It's not just about having novel ideas—it's about executing them in ways that make a real difference, whether that's solving a problem, improving a process, or creating new opportunities. Innovation requires not just creativity and ideation, but also resources, persistence, and practical execution. The iPod was an innovation because it actually brought that "thousand songs in your pocket" vision to market and changed how people experienced music.

# Celebrate

"A hyper-realistic, high-resolution press photograph capturing the peak moment of a grand celebration. Focus on a female victorious cyclist in sharp detail, as if taken by a professional sports photographer. She should be wearing a cycling jersey with a prominent Baloise logo, clearly visible on the chest of her jersey. She is holding a champagne bottle mid-spray, celebrating her win. The background features a blurred but recognizable crowd, expressing raw, ecstatic emotion – mouths open in cheers, hands raised in jubilation. Confetti is frozen in motion, and stadium lights glint off metallic surfaces. Emphasize authentic expressions, dynamic action, and true-to-life lighting, avoiding any artificial or stylized elements. The image should feel immediate, unposed, and perfectly timed, like a snapshot from a live event.
